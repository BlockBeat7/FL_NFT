This document outlines the design concept for tokenizing parameters in federated learning into NFTs, including frontend, backend, and IPFS design. The software development will be based on this document.

Frontend

Web3 identity recognition supporting mainstream Web3 wallets, including MetaMask, TokenPocket, and OKX Wallet, and successfully initiating authorization and signing. For users, this means when they click "connect wallet," the aforementioned Web3 wallets should correctly prompt.
Providing a channel for uploading parameters. For users, there should be an "upload" channel where they can click to upload parameters from their local storage.
Compilation process. When users click the "compile" button, their parameters will be passed to IPFS, and IPFS will return a CID indicating that the NFT construction is ready.
NFT generation. When users click the "generate" button, an interaction with a smart contract will occur, releasing the NFT on ERC-20.
Integration with NFT markets like OpenSea, enabling direct buying and selling transactions.
